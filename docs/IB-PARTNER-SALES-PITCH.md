# SCALPERIUM IB PARTNER PROGRAM

## Transform Your FTD Revenue Model Into Sustainable Monthly Recurring Income

---

### THE PROBLEM YOU'RE FACING

You're grinding to acquire new traders every month. You bring in 100 FTDs, they burn out in 30-60 days, and you're back to square one. Your monthly revenue looks like a roller coaster instead of a growth curve. You're spending more on acquisition than you're making in retention. Sound familiar?

**The traditional FTD model is broken.** Traders lose money, blame you, chargeback, and leave. You're stuck on a hamster wheel replacing churned clients just to maintain revenue.

---

### THE SCALPERIUM SOLUTION

SCALPERIUM is not a signal service. It's not copy trading. It's not another EA that puts liability on you.

**SCALPERIUM is a fully automated trading system where traders maintain complete control** while you generate predictable monthly spread commissions equal to or exceeding your current FTD revenue—without any responsibility for their trading outcomes.

---

### HOW IT WORKS

**Market Signal Indicators (Traffic Light System):**

- 🟢 **GREEN** = Favorable market conditions detected. High probability trading window.
- 🟠 **ORANGE** = Moderate conditions. Proceed with caution.
- 🔴 **RED** = Unfavorable conditions. Avoid trading.

**Traders see these signals in real-time and decide when to activate or deactivate their trading.** They click START when conditions are favorable. They click STOP when conditions turn unfavorable.

**You provide the tool. They make the decisions. Zero IB liability.**

---

### AUTOMATED RE-ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM

When traders go inactive for 3-7 days, the system automatically calculates missed profit opportunities based on favorable signal periods they weren't active.

**Automated messages sent via email and SMS:**

- "You missed 12 GREEN signal opportunities worth $847 in potential profit this week."
- "SCALPERIUM signals were favorable for 6 hours today. Login now to capitalize."
- "You've been inactive for 5 days. Traders following signals this week averaged $1,240 in profit."

**Result:** 40-60% of inactive traders return within 48 hours and resume trading activity.

**You don't send a single message. The system does everything automatically.**

---

### YOUR REVENUE PROJECTIONS

Based on average trading activity of 15 trades per day per trader at $3.50 spread per trade over 22 trading days per month:

**500 Active Traders:**
- Monthly Spread Revenue: **$57,750**
- FTD Equivalent Value: **192 FTDs**
- Annual Revenue: **$693,000**

**1,000 Active Traders:**
- Monthly Spread Revenue: **$115,500**
- FTD Equivalent Value: **385 FTDs**
- Annual Revenue: **$1,386,000**

**2,500 Active Traders:**
- Monthly Spread Revenue: **$288,750**
- FTD Equivalent Value: **962 FTDs**
- Annual Revenue: **$3,465,000**

**Unlike FTDs that burn out in 30-60 days, SCALPERIUM traders stay active for 6-12+ months because they're actually profitable.** Your monthly spreads become as predictable as SaaS recurring revenue.

---

### WHY TRADERS STAY LONGER AND TRADE MORE

**Profitability drives retention.** When traders control when they trade based on favorable market signals, they experience:

- **65-75% win rates** (vs industry average 10-20%)
- **Month-over-month account growth** (instead of steady losses)
- **6-12+ month retention** (vs typical 30-60 days)
- **Higher referral rates** (winning traders recruit friends)

**Your traders make money. You make money. Everyone wins.**

---

### ZERO IB LIABILITY

This is critical: **You are not providing signals. You are not managing trades. You are not responsible for P&L.**

You're providing access to a market analysis tool that displays condition indicators. **Traders activate and deactivate their own strategies based on those indicators.** Every action is logged and timestamped with full legal disclaimers built into the platform UI.

**If a trader loses money, it's because they traded during unfavorable conditions or ignored the signals.** Not because you gave them bad advice. You gave them a tool—they controlled how to use it.

This removes regulatory liability and customer service headaches that come with traditional signal services or managed accounts.

---

### 100% WHITE LABEL SOLUTION

### BUILT-IN GAMIFICATION AND RETENTION

**Leaderboards with daily, weekly, and monthly prizes** create competition and engagement. Traders want to be ranked #1. They trade more to climb the rankings. They stay active longer to defend their position.

**Prize tiers are fully configurable by you:**
- 1st Place: $2,000 (Monthly)
- 2nd Place: $1,000 (Monthly)
- 3rd Place: $500 (Monthly)

Plus daily and weekly prizes to maintain constant engagement.

**Leaderboards drive organic growth.** Winning traders screenshot their rankings and share with friends. You get free viral marketing from satisfied customers.

### REAL-TIME ANALYTICS DASHBOARD

- Revenue per trader per day
- Activation rates and trading frequency
- Churn analysis and retention curves
- Lifetime value (LTV) calculations
- Broker-level performance breakdowns
- Account type segmentation (demo vs live)

**Make data-driven decisions to scale your operation.** Know exactly which acquisition channels deliver the highest LTV. Identify and re-engage at-risk traders before they churn.

**Full transparency into your business metrics at all times.**

### LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AVAILABILITY

**We only onboard 25 IB partners per quarter.** This ensures quality white-label implementation, dedicated technical support, and proper broker integrations.

We're not building a mass-market SaaS tool. We're building a premium partner ecosystem. **We'd rather serve 25 partners exceptionally than 100 partners poorly.**

**Current status: 13 partnerships confirmed for Q1 2026. 12 slots remaining.**

Once capacity is reached, the next availability is Q2 2026. If you wait, you're leaving $300,000+ on the table over the next 3 months (based on 1,000 trader projection).

---

### REQUIREMENTS FOR PARTNERSHIP

To qualify as a SCALPERIUM IB partner, you must:

1. Have an existing MT5 broker relationship (or be willing to establish one)
2. Currently manage or have access to 100+ active traders (or realistic acquisition plan)
3. Demonstrate commitment to compliance and regulatory standards
4. Provide necessary branding assets for white-label setup
5. Agree to terms of service and partnership agreement

**Applications are reviewed within 48 hours. Setup begins immediately upon approval.**

---

### THE DECISION

You have two paths:

**Path 1:** Continue with the traditional FTD model. Keep spending on acquisition. Keep replacing churned traders every 30-60 days. Keep dealing with chargebacks and complaints. Keep hoping next month will be better.

**Path 2:** Switch to SCALPERIUM. Build a base of profitable traders who stay active for 6-12+ months. Generate predictable monthly recurring revenue. Scale systematically with data-driven insights. Eliminate IB liability. Sleep better at night.

**The math is simple.** 1,000 traders on SCALPERIUM generates $115,500/month in spreads with 6-12 month retention. That's equivalent to acquiring 385 FTDs every single month—except you don't have to replace them because they're actually profitable and stay active.
